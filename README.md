# CFileCode
This is an add-on to MS-Dos, all you have to install and go into cmd.exe and type CFile to start!
The program was created by Ben Jankowski, all credit goes to Ben Jankowski. If you would like to add on please go to cfilecode.weebly.com and tell me in the contact tab on the website and tell me there and if its good I will add it.
I take no blame if you hurt people by editing this program and sending it out, ONLY DOWNLOAD "CFile Install.exe" FROM THE WEBSITE!
